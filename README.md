# Kickstart CMS
Basic CMS system written in PHP/MySQL

## Introducting Kickstart
Kickstart is intended to be a small, simple PHP/MySQL Content Management System (CMS) for building dynamic websites.

This easy-to-use CMS system is built on the concept of adding small-footprint "modules" as needed to let your site grow with you, rather than forcing you to install and manage features you don't use or need.

Kickstart is being designed and developed (rather slowly) by [Doug Lockwood](https://github.com/lockworld).

### Version 1.0
The first version of this site will be a concept that was created a few years ago. It is somewhat outdated, and may not be fully functional. It will gradually be updated and modernized in future releases.
